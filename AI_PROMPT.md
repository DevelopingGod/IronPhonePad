# AI Prompt Used

**Tool:** OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4o) / Gemini

**Prompt:**
"Act as a Senior .NET Architect. I am starting a C# technical assessment where I need to implement a 'Old Phone Pad' decoder.

**My Goal:**
I want to demonstrate professional engineering standards with a clean, production-ready solution structure. **I will write the actual C# logic for the decoder myself**, but I need your help setting up the environment.

**Request:**
1. Propose a robust project structure (Solution file, Core Class Library, Console Runner, and NUnit Test Project).
2. Provide the specific `.NET CLI` commands to create these projects, link the references (Console -> Core, Tests -> Core), and add them to the solution.
3. Create a `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` file for a CI pipeline that builds and tests on push.
4. Explain step-by-step how to run the console app and execute the tests using the VS Code terminal.

**Constraints:**
- Use .NET 10.
- Do not write the implementation of the `OldPhonePad` method; I will do that.
- Focus on the project configuration and developer experience."
